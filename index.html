                  <p>Students may think they can take it easy and that they’ll be “passed along” in classes. The
                    requirements for college are much different than high school, however. If a student doesn’t earn a C
                    average in their first semester, they can be suspended. So, they will need to keep track of their
                    assignments, communicate with their instructors and stayed engaged in their classes to succeed. If
                    you are already worried about how your student will perform academically, let them know what your
                    expectations are and how you will support them as they start this new academic chapter.
                    <br><br>
                    Other students may be extremely stressed about what the workload will be like and may be ready to
                    focus only on academics. You know your student better than anyone. If you have a student who you
                    think will put a lot of pressure on themself academically, remind them that they should have some
                    fun and get involved, too! You might want to suggest they reach out to their faculty advisor early
                    on to make that scholarly connection.

                  <p>Having a roommate can be difficult for anyone who has never shared a room before. Even students who
                    find their roommates at Summer Orientation or through social media, and think they have found their
                    perfect match, could have a tough time eventually sharing their space. Talking your student through
                    the ups and downs of sharing a room will be helpful to them
                    <br><br>
                    Students who will have to commute may find it tough to make connections. They may complain about
                    parking (which happens on every college campus!), and they may not realize how much effort they will
                    need to put forth to be engaged on campus. Let them know about the Commuter Lounge in the Student
                    Center, the importance of getting involved and discuss how they plan to manage commuting, school,
                    and work (if they have a job).

                  <p>TV, movies, and social media can make it look like college is one giant party. Many students come
                    in thinking it will be the “best time of their lives.” In reality, though, college is regular life.
                    If your student wants a vibrant social life, they’ll need to be friendly or attend campus events,
                    even if they don’t have someone to go with. Clubs, activities, events, lounges like the Office of
                    Diversity Programs, the First-Gen Lounge, or Commuter lounge, campus jobs, and intramural sports are
                    all great ways for students to make connections, but they always need to take the first step and
                    actually go.</p>

            <h3>Will I be able to access my student’s grades and other information? (Understanding FERPA)</h3>
            <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of
              student education records. It gives students the right to control who can access their academic
              information once they turn 18 or enroll in college, regardless of their age. What does this mean for
              parents and supporters? If you have been used to having full access to your students’ grades, attendance,
              and behavior records, that will no longer be the case!
              <br><br>
              Parents and supporters cannot access their student’s academic or financial information unless the student
              gives consent, even if you are the one paying the bill! Students can grant access to their records by
              signing the FERPA authorization for disclosure of non-directory information from within their my.snhu
              account, but even then, you might not get the updates that you want.
               <br><br>
              Take this time now to encourage your student to communicate openly and responsibly with you and make a
              plan for how you will communicate together if life at college isn’t going quite as they planned, or any
              challenges arise.
